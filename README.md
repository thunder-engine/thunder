### Attention

This engine still in the development and stuff **will break**.
If this happens, the first thing to do is clear your project's cache directory and restart the editor.
If this doesnt helped please rize an issue.
Remember, by reporting problems or asking questions in public, you are **helping other people**!

### About

The main ideology of project is to create the modular engine.
It will give developers an ability to exclude modules which they are not using in their project to keep their projects lightweight.
API of Thunder Engine is also allowing to create own modules to use them in your games or in game editor.
