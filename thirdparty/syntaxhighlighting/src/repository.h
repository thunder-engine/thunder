/**
 * @brief Syntax highlighting repository.
 *
 * @section repo_intro Introduction
 *
 * The Repository gives access to all syntax Definitions available on the
 * system, typically described in *.xml files. The Definition files are read
 * from the resource that is compiled into the executable, and from the file
 * system. If a Definition exists in the resource and on the file system,
 * then the one from the file system is chosen.
 *
 * @section repo_access Definitions and Themes
 *
 * Typically, only one instance of the Repository is needed. This single
 * instance can be thought of as a singleton you keep alive throughout the
 * lifetime of your application. Then, either call definitionForName() with the
 * given language name (e.g. "QML" or "Java"), or definitionForFileName() to
 * obtain a Definition based on the filename/mimetype of the file. The
 * function definitions() returns a list of all available syntax Definition%s.
 *
 * In addition to Definitions, the Repository also provides a list of Themes.
 * A Theme is defined by a set of default text style colors as well as editor
 * colors. These colors together provide all required colros for drawing all
 * primitives of a text editor. All available Theme%s can be queried through
 * themes(), and a Theme with a specific name is obtained through theme().
 * Additionally, defaultTheme() provides a way to obtain a default theme for
 * either a light or a black color theme.
 *
 * @section repo_search_paths Search Paths
 *
 * All highlighting Definition and Theme files are compiled into the shared
 * KSyntaxHighlighting library by using the Qt resource system. Loading
 * additional files from disk is supported as well.
 *
 * Loading syntax Definition files works as follows:
 *
 * -# First, all syntax highlighting files are loaded that are located in
 *    QStandardPaths::locateAll(QStandardPaths::GenericDataLocation, QStringLiteral("org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax"), QStandardPaths::LocateDirectory);
 *    Under Unix, this uses $XDG_DATA_HOME and $XDG_DATA_DIRS, which could
 *    map to $HOME/.local5/share/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax and
 *    /usr/share/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax.
 *
 * -# Next, for backwards compatibility with Kate, all syntax highlighting
 *    files are loaded that are located in
 *    QStandardPaths::locateAll(QStandardPaths::GenericDataLocation, QStringLiteral("katepart5/syntax"), QStandardPaths::LocateDirectory);
 *    Again, under Unix, this uses $XDG_DATA_HOME and $XDG_DATA_DIRS, which
 *    could map to $HOME/.local5/share/katepart5/syntax and
 *    /usr/share/katepart5/syntax.
 *
 * -# Then, all files compiled into the library through resources are loaded.
 *    The internal resource path is ":/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax".
 *    This path should never be touched by other applications.
 *
 * -# Finally, the search path can be extended by calling addCustomSearchPath().
 *    A custom search path can either be a path on disk or again a path to
 *    a Qt resource.
 *
 * Similarly, loading Theme files works as follows:
 *
 * -# First, all Theme files are loaded that are located in
 *    QStandardPaths::locateAll(QStandardPaths::GenericDataLocation, QStringLiteral("org.kde.syntax-highlighting/themes"), QStandardPaths::LocateDirectory);
 *    Under Unix, this uses $XDG_DATA_HOME and $XDG_DATA_DIRS, which could
 *    map to $HOME/.local5/share/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/themes and
 *    /usr/share/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/themes.
 *
 * -# Then, all files compiled into the library through resources are loaded.
 *    The internal resource path is ":/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/themes".
 *    This path should never be touched by other applications.
 *
 * -# Finally, all Theme%s located in the paths added addCustomSearchPath()
 *    are loaded.
 *
 * @note Whenever a Definition or a Theme exists twice, the variant with
 *       higher version is used.
 *
 * @note The QStandardPaths lookup can be disabled by compiling the framework with the -DNO_STANDARD_PATHS define.
 *
 * @see Definition, Theme, AbstractHighlighter
 * @since 5.28
