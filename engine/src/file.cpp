    \class File
    \brief Basic file system I/O module.
    \inmodule Engine

    The File class provides an interface for reading from and writing to files.
    File expects the file separator to be '/' regardless of operating system. The use of other separators (e.g., '\') is not supported.

    You can check for a file's existence using _exists(), and remove a file using _delete().
    You can create a directory using _mkdir(), list all files in directory using _flist() and retrive other basic information.

    The file can be opened with _open() and closed with _fclose(). Data is usually can be read with _fread() and written with _fwrite().

    Common usecase:
    \code
    File *file = Engine::file();
    _FILE *fp   = file->_fopen("filename", "r");
    if(fp) {
        ByteArray data;
        data.resize(file->_fsize(fp));
        file->_fread(&data[0], data.size(), 1, fp);
        file->_fclose(fp);
    }
    \endcode
